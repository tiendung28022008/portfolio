        <p>I always try to help my parents with household chores. I usually do the dishes after meals and take out the trash every evening. I also water the plants in the garden and sweep the floor to keep our house clean. On weekends, I help my mom cook meals and look after my younger sibling. I feel happy because helping my parents makes our family life easier and more enjoyable.

        <p>I have achieved several good results in my studies. I always try my best in class, and I have earned high scores in many subjects, especially English and Math. Last semester, I received a certificate of merit for being one of the top students in my class. I also participated in a school English competition and won second prize. These achievements motivate me to keep working hard and improve myself every day.</p>
